To being a working local repository:

```
Clone the repository to a directory.

Then use `git clone <url>`

Enter the directory and use `git init`
```

To add files you've been working on, on your local repository:
```
Use `git add .` to add all changed files. The period means 'all'.

`git commit -m "<msg">` to solidify the changes.

`git push origin <branch>` to send the changes to github.
```

List the files you've changed and those you still need to add or commit:
```
`git status`
```
