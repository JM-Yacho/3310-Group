To being a working local repository:


1. Clone the repository to a directory.

2. Then use `git clone <url>`

3. Enter the directory and use `git init`


To add files you've been working on, on your local repository:

- Use `git add .` to add all changed files. The period means 'all'.

- `git commit -m "<msg">` to solidify the changes.

- `git push origin <branch>` to send the changes to github.


List the files you've changed and those you still need to add or commit:

- `git status`
